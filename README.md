# Gamification in Education

## Overview 

CMSC 340 Gamification in Education is a passion project turned independent study course at the University of Richmond that I created from scratch in tandem with Dr. David Balash in the computer science department. The overarching goal of the course was to provide me with a chance of making my own game in which to test my hypotheses about which specific components of gamification drive the educational benefits, particularly within schoolchildren. I additionally collaborated with Dr. Karen Kochel, a developmental psychologist at UR, for the psychological research portion of the project.

## Credits

The [Complete Fire Red Upgrade (CFRU)](https://github.com/Skeli789/Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade) and the [Dynamic Pokemon Expansion (DPE)](https://github.com/Skeli789/Dynamic-Pokemon-Expansion) are dynamic data expansions that can be applied to the original Pokemon FireRed Game Boy Advance (GBA) ROM, vastly overhauling the game engine with updated features and mechanics, and opening up doors for immense levels of customization. [Hex Maniac Advance](https://github.com/haven1433/HexManiacAdvance/releases) is an advanced hex editor built specifically for customizing Pokemon GBA ROMs. These three tools were essential for making this project possible, and their respective creators poured thousands of hours of work into them for the benefit of the community.

The folders `CFRU Files` and `DPE Files` consist of all the files in the respective data injections that I made personal changes to for my project. To view the original, unchanged repositories, visit the respective links above.

`CMSC 340 Final Product.gba` was the final game deliverable at the end of the independent study course. While it does not have complete quality of life changes, visual additions, and other detail work, it contains the core of the experimental manipulation that would be used in a gamification study. The other main deliverable from this course is the `CMSC 340 Final Write-Up`, which consists of a literature review on gamification and my proposed gamification experiment utilizing the game I created for the project.

Before this became an academic endeavor, it began as a passion project, which now continues on. `Most Recent.gba` is a copy of the most recent version in development, which is stripped of the experimental conditions, and is instead just a game to play for fun. 

Note: any .gba file can be properly opened and run using a GBA Emulator.
